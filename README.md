# PHP Composer Package Starter Example


## Usage

Download this repository as a zip file without the Git history, rename it, run `git init` to initialize an empty git repository and then get cracking creating your own package.


## Extras

_The `illuminate/database` package is required for development testing, however if this package is intended to be a Laravel package and/or a package that needs database transactions, feel free to move `illuminate/database` from `require-dev` to `require`._
